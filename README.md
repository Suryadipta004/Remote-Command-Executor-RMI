# Remote-Command-Executor-RMI
A CLI-based Remote Command Executor using Java RMI. The client sends shell commands to a remote server, which executes them and returns the output to the client. The project demonstrates inter-process communication (IPC) using Java RMI and handles multi-line command outputs, exceptions, and secure communication.
